    "A VotingRegressor is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple base estimators to make a final prediction. Each base estimator is trained on the entire dataset, and the predictions of all the base estimators are averaged to produce the final prediction. The VotingRegressor can be used for both regression and classification tasks."
